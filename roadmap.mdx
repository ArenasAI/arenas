# AI Data Analysis App Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
**Objective**: Build a stable foundation to ensure smooth development and deployment.

### Tasks:
1. **Tech Stack Validation**
   - **Next.js (TypeScript)**: Structure the project following best practices (e.g., modular components, API routes for serverless functions).
   - **Supabase**: Configure authentication (email, social login) and database schema for user management, analysis history, and runtime selection.
   - **Tailwind CSS**: Create reusable utility classes and themes for a cohesive design system.

2. **Initial Prompt Page Design**
   - Design a landing page with:
     - A prompt input box (multi-line support).
     - Options for runtime selection (Python/Julia/R).
     - A "Get Started" or "Analyze Now" button.
   - **Improvement**: Add an example prompt section to guide first-time users.

3. **Free AI Model Integration**
   - Select a pre-trained open-source model (e.g., Hugging Face's GPT models or scikit-learn pipelines).
   - Create a modular backend structure for easy switching between AI models.

4. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Deploy the app and set up environment variables for sensitive data.
   - Use Vercel's analytics tools to monitor traffic and usage.

## Phase 2: Core Features Development
**Objective**: Build the main functionality and improve user experience.

### Tasks:
1. **Data Upload & Preprocessing**
   - Enable users to upload CSV/Excel files.
   - Implement preprocessing options (e.g., data cleaning, missing value handling) using libraries like Pandas (Python), DataFrames.jl (Julia), or dplyr (R).

2. **Runtime Implementation**
   - Add API routes to execute code in the selected runtime.
   - Use Docker containers or microservices to isolate runtimes securely.
   - **Improvement**: Implement runtime resource limits to prevent abuse (e.g., timeouts).

3. **Visualization Features**
   - Support dynamic visualizations using libraries like Plotly, Vega-Lite, or D3.js.
   - Add interactive features like zoom, pan, and export (PNG/SVG).

4. **Result Page Design**
   - Display analysis results with:
     - Visualizations.
     - Textual insights.
     - A download option for reports.
   - **Improvement**: Use tabs or sections for multi-step analysis outputs.

## Phase 3: Testing & Optimization
**Objective**: Ensure reliability, scalability, and performance.

### Tasks:
1. **Testing**
   - Create unit and integration tests for frontend and backend.
   - Mock user sessions to test different runtime workflows.
   - **Improvement**: Add end-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize bundle sizes using tree-shaking and dynamic imports in Next.js.
   - Use caching for frequent database queries.
   - Optimize Supabase queries for speed and scalability.

3. **Budget-Friendly Enhancements**
   - Explore lightweight AI models to reduce hosting costs.
   - Use Supabase's storage for file uploads and backups instead of external services.

## Phase 4: Launch & User Feedback
**Objective**: Release a beta version and gather insights for improvement.

### Tasks:
1. **Beta Launch**
   - Target students, data scientists, and engineers through forums, LinkedIn, and niche communities (e.g., Kaggle, Reddit).
   - Create a short tutorial video or documentation for onboarding.

2. **Feedback Collection**
   - Add a feedback form within the app for user suggestions.
   - Use tools like Hotjar to analyze user interaction and identify pain points.

3. **Improvement Suggestions**
   - Implement frequently requested features (e.g., real-time collaboration).
   - Improve UI/UX based on feedback.

---

## Phase 5: Scaling & Monetization
**Objective**: Expand the user base and introduce monetization features.

### Tasks:
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Add support for more file formats (JSON, SQL dumps).
   - Implement API access for programmatic analysis.

2. **Monetization Options**
   - Offer premium plans with advanced models and features (e.g., larger datasets, faster runtimes).
   - Provide an ad-free experience for paying users.

3. **Scalability**
   - Transition from free-tier hosting to paid tiers as usage grows.
   - Optimize runtimes for serverless execution to reduce costs.
