Completed/In Progress:

Tech stack decisions (Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS)
Initial planning for AI model integration (with Ollama and Qwen 2.5)
Consideration of visualization tools (Plotly.jl)

Key Items Still Needed:

Foundation & Setup:
Initial prompt page implementation
AI model integration setup with Ollama/Qwen 2.5
Vercel deployment configuration
Core Features:
Data upload functionality
Runtime implementation (Python/Julia/R)
Visualization integration (Consider alternatives to Plotly.jl for specific use cases)
Results page design
Remaining Phases:
All testing & optimization tasks
Launch & user feedback collection
Scaling & monetization features

Suggestion: While Plotly.jl is powerful, consider also exploring Vega-Lite for simpler visualizations or D3.js for custom interactive charts to ensure you're using the best tool for each specific visualization need.

suggestions will be considered.
